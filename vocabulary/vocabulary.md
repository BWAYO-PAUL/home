## Branch
A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. It is an essential feature available in most modern version control systems. 

## Merging
Merging is a process to put a forked history back together. The git merge command facilitates you to take the data created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

## Clone
The git clone is a Git command-line utility. It is used to make a copy of the target repository or clone it. If I want a local copy of my repository from GitHub, this tool allows creating a local copy of that repository on your local directory from the repository URL.
